## ‚öôÔ∏è Process
The dashboard development followed these steps:

**2.** Data Cleaning: Null values handled, fields formatted, and irrelevant data removed using Excel and Tableau Prep.

**3.** Data Import: Loaded the cleaned dataset into Tableau.

**4.** Data Exploration: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key metrics and dimensions.

**5.** Dashboard Design:

- Used color-coded charts, histograms, pie charts, and KPIs.

- Built interactive filters (e.g., education dropdown).

- Created a responsive layout for key insights.

## üîç Project Insights
- The overall attrition rate is 16.12%, with 237 employees having left the organization.
